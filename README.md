## 🧩 Project Summary
**StellarYield** is a unified DeFi dashboard and automated yield-routing system built on the Stellar network. It aggregates real-time APY rates from across the ecosystem, uses an AI layer to analyze risk, and leverages Soroban smart contracts to automatically rebalance user funds into the highest-paying liquidity pools.

**Key Benefits:**
* ⚡ **One-Click Rebalancing:** Move funds between protocols via Soroban smart contracts.
* 🧠 **AI Risk Assessment:** Claude-powered recommendations based on your personal risk tolerance.
* 🔍 **Unified Dashboard:** Compare Blend, Soroswap, and DeFindex APYs side-by-side.
* 💰 **Optimized Returns:** Never miss a yield spike; the auto-vault does the heavy lifting.

## 🚨 Problem This Solves
The Stellar DeFi ecosystem is expanding, but liquidity opportunities are highly fragmented.

| Problem | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scattered Liquidity** | Users must manually visit 5+ different dApps daily to compare current APY rates. |
| **Manual Rebalancing** | Users lose potential yield while away from their screens or miss sudden APY spikes. |
| **Risk Complexity** | High APY percentages often mask low liquidity, impermanent loss, or protocol risks. |
| **Friction & Time** | Manually withdrawing and redepositing across protocols requires multiple transactions. |

---

## 💡 Core Concept
Instead of users manually hunting for yield, StellarYield acts as a centralized command center. Users connect their Freighter wallet, consult the AI Advisor for a personalized strategy, and deposit funds into a Soroban Vault that automatically routes capital to the best-performing Stellar protocols.

🔑 Main Actors
| Actor | Role |
|---|---|
| Depositor (User) | Connects wallet, sets risk tolerance, and deposits XLM/USDC. |
| AI Advisor | Analyzes real-time TVL/APY data and recommends allocation strategies. |
| Backend Engine | Fetches and caches APY data every 15 minutes to prevent API rate-limiting. |
| Soroban Vault | Smart contract holding user deposits; executes the routing logic to dApps. |
